# COVID-19 Deaths by Country Visualization 
A demonstration on how to easily generate informative public health visualizations using Python

Learning programming and data science can seem daunting but I’m going to illustrate how anyone can easily get started analyzing public health data in just a few minutes.

Let’s get started!

First, we’ll be analyzing current COVID-19 confirmed deaths. In order to practice ethical data science it’s important to disclose where our dataset is coming from. In this case, we’ll be using the COVID-19 confirmed deaths dataset from Our World in Data (OWID), a scientific online publication associated with the charity Global Change Data Lab and the University of Oxford. It’s important to note this dataset likely underestimates the total deaths resulting from COVID-19 infection. Sometimes, even with disclosing a source, data can be easily manipulated, as Jeff Leek, former co-director of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab pointed out in this blog post. 

The great thing about the code we write today is that it is fully reproducible and open-source! Anyone with a computer and internet connection can access the Google Colab notebook I’ll link to at the end of this article. 

First download the file from here: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv

Then, follow the instructions in my notebook from either Github or Google Colab. Make sure you install the Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
